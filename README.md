# **Fire and Smoke Detection with YOLOv8**

This repository contains the implementation of a **Fire and Smoke Detection** system using the YOLOv8 model. The model is trained on custom images of fire and smoke to perform real-time object detection.

## **âš¡ Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to build a **fire and smoke detection system** that can identify and localize fire and smoke in images and videos using deep learning models. We used the **YOLOv8M** model for object detection, which provides accurate and fast performance for this task.
